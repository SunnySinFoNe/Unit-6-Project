            <p>Welcome to <strong class="southEvery">South Everywhere</strong>, the second oldest realm within the Realms of Unity. Long ago, a tyrant came and flipped the culture of the world upside down, as the once mostly magic-less citizens were suddenly given power like they’d never seen before thanks to a righteous rebellion. Many centuries later, magic has become the norm, but that doesn’t mean everyone uses it. <strong class="protag">Marion</strong> is among those who’ve opted out of magic, for fear of its dangerous unpredictability. But that doesn’t mean everyone is satisfied with the ordinary, like <strong class="rubie">Rhubarb</strong>, Marion’s best friend. One day, Marion was on their way to work, when Rhubarb approached them… </p>

Rhubarb is meant to be Madame Phantasm's apprentice. But you, Marion, have a different fate, but we will not speak on that now.">

            <p> Rhubarb smirked. <q class="rubie">Knew you couldn't resist. I'm just too cute.</q> Rhubarb grabs you by the arm and drags you back down the road towards Outta-Wack Woods.</p>

            <p>You and Rhubarb are standing before the Outta-Wack Woods. You can practically feel the magic that courses through every branch, every creature, and anything else that lurks within. You feel like turning back.</p>
            <p>But Rhubarb has no such mentality. <q class="rubie">C'mon, Marion!</q> And with a yank, she pulls you into the forest. </p>
            <p> As you tread deeper and deeper into the wood, you become more and more wary of what lies ahead. You see Rhubarb ahead of you, far enough to where she may not even notice if you were to slip away.</p>

            <p>You turned around and walked back through the way you believe you came through. You loved Rhubarb, you did, but you had responsibilites. She would never understand that.</p>
            <p>You stop in place, and look around. Every direction looks exactly the same. It's making you dizzy. So dizzy, in fact, that it almost looks like the trees are...</p>
            <p>Something grabs your leg and pulls you downwards. The dirt piles on top of you, all attempts to break free null and void. The last thing you see is a the trees, spiraling together until the little light above you is gone.</p>

            <p><q class="protag">What in the realms-?</q></p>
            <p>Rhubarb's face lights up. <q class="rubie">Mari, do you <em>know</em> what this <em>is</em>?</q> After a few moments, she continues. <q class="rubie">It's the original Madame Phantasm's Emporium of The Strange!</q></p>
            <p><q class="protag">That old witch from history class?</q> Caution crawled up your spine as you looked at the little shack. This place belonged to one of the biggest magic users out there, no place for a citizen of Mundane Coast.</p>

            <p>Rhubarb looked around.<q class="rubie">Who said that?</q></p>
            <p>You start looking around to, but all you see are trees...</p>
            <p>Wait a second. What's <em>that</em>?</p>
            <p>A giant tree was right there, taller and wider than any you've ever seen. But most unusual of all was its bark, wood glowing a bright green, and patterns that almsot resembled a face.</p>
            <p><q>Hello,</q>said the tree, and you almost leaped out of your skin.</p>
            <p><q class="rubie">Woah, a talking tree!</q> Rhubarb exclaimed.</p>
            <p><q>Yes, I do speak. But please, young ones, heed my warning. A step untaken will leave you with regret. Take risks one in while, or else you will be doomed to an eternity of turmoil as you think of what might've been. Take this warning, travelers, and-</q></p>
            <p>You were already pushing Rhubarb away. <q class="protag">Yeah, thank but no thanks. We'll just run along now. So long, whatever you are...</q></p>
            <p>Finally, you manage to pull Rhubarb from the woods, and sigh with relief as you look back the the menacing plants that looked like a sea of desperate claws grasping hungrily at the sun. Things were quiet...</p>
            <p><q class="rubie">Why'd you do that?</q></p>
            <p>You blinked and turned toward your friend.<q class="protag">What?</q></p>
            <p><q class="rubie">You know...</q>she began, her voice uncharacteristically small and quiet, lacking its usual energy that somehow drained you way less than whatever was going on right now.<q class="rubie">I originally wanted to come here to spend time with you. Every time we make plans, you always have something more important to do. Something more important than me.</q></p>
            <p>You sighed. <q class="protag">Rubie...</q></p>
            <p><q class="rubie"> No, its fine. Just...go. Go to your job. Go home. Go somewhere. Somewhere safe... Somewhere boring... Somewhere without me. Just go enjoy your adult life, because you've clearly grown out of fun adventures and friendships.</q> She didn't bother to try and meet your eyes, and just walked away. Leaving you standing there. You are speechless.</p>

        <div class="yayCandy">
            <p>You shrug yoour shoulder and start walking towards the shop. You figured that you would scout out the place before Rhubarb, considering her habit of touching everything. The inside looks barren and banged up, as if someone had ransacked the place long before your arrival. All that was left was a bowl on the main desk, filled to the brim with golden-</p>
            <p><q class="rubie">Candy!</q> Rhubarb rushed past you and all but lept towards the bowl, scooping up a handful. <q class="rubie"> I'm so going to stuff my face with these.</q></p>
            <p><q class="protag">Are you sure that's the best idea? We don't even know if that candy's still good...</q></p>

            <p><q class="rubie">Mari! Mari! Mari! Mari! Mari! Mari! Mari!</q> Rhubarb chanted, waving the bowl towards you excitedly.</p>
            <p>A familiar rumble in your gut reminds you that you hadn't eaten breakfast that morning. And the candy did look really good...</p>
            <p><q class="protag">Ugh, alright. Gimme.</q>You pluck out a single piece of candy, unwrapping it and popping it into your mouth. You can't place the taste but it definitely matched the yellow color of it. The sugar melted in your mouth in a way that was vaguely familar, but, again. unplaceable.</p>
            <p><q class="rubie">How's it taste, Mari?</q> you hear Rhubarb ask. <q class="rubie">Mari? Marion?!</q> You freinds panic would normally trigger your own, but you felt strangely at ease...And tired. Vaguely tired...</p>
            <p>Your eyes closed for a moment, and when you opened them, you weren't in the emporium anymore. You were in a warm, golden field, the long grass dancing as the wind brushed across it. The sun was high in the sky, but it wasn't making you feel dried out like it usually does. It was just as warm and yellow as everything else. You couldn't even remember what you were doing before. But you knew that you were tired. Vaguely tired...</p>
            <p>You closed your eyes again, and the warm sensation were gone. You eyes fluttered open, and you sat up. Wait, since when have you been laying down? You realize that you are now in your room, dark and dreary as the deep ocean. Your bed creaked beneath you as you stood up onto the cold, damp floor of your abode. A glance at your bedside clock told you it was 8 in the morning. Had you been asleep this whole time?</p>
            <p>Weren't you just in Outta-Wack Woods? Where was Rhubarb? Did none of that actually happen?</p>
            <p>You sigh and start to leave your room, but you step on something that makes a strange <em>crunch</em>. A look beneath your foot revealed a golden candy wrapper. You vaguely remember it, but you're too tired to actually figure it out. Plus, you have to get to work.</p>

            <p>You push the bowl away despite the protests from your gut. <q class="protag">No, Rhub. This stuff has probably been sitting here for years.</q></p>
            <p><q>Oh, I really wouldn't eat those if I were you. The recent change in recipe is causing some strange effects involving time travel. I may have to stop selling them.</q></p>
            <p>You both turn to see an elderly woman, dressed in purple robes, smiling. She radiates an energy that may rival that of the forest's. Something about her seems familiar. And powerful. So very powerful.</p>
            <p><q class="rubie">Oh my gosh, it's <em>you</em>!</q> Rhubarb practically bounded towards the stranger. <q class="rubie">You're Madam Phantasm!</q></p>
            <p><q>Indeed I am,</q> said the elderly woman. <q>What are two lovely young people such as yourselves doing here?</q></p>

            <p>The woman let out a hearty laugh, no malice in its tone. <q>Oh, my dear, it's quite alright. This place is open to the public, although it is looking rather ragged right now. I could use some help.</q></p>
            <p><q class="protag">Well-</q></p>
            <p><q class="rubie">Sure thing!</q> Rhubarb started picking up sticks from the floor, and then looked at you. <q class="rubie">It's only fair.</q></p>
            <p>You look warily arond the store. Everything here hums with magic, reminding you of the weird lights they had put up at Mr. Paeonia's that made you feel queasy.</p>
            <p><q>You know,</q> Madame Phantasm was suddenly standing much closer to you than you remembered. <q>I'm surprised a water sprite lives in Mundane Coast. Your kind is known for their magic. It's in your blood.</q></p>
            <p>You stare at her in awe. <q class="protag">I wouldn't know. I take after my mom, and she-</q> You stop yourself, seeing the pity start to creep onto her face. <q class="protag">Magic is dangerous and unpredicatble. I don't want to mess with that.</q></p>
            <p><q>It doesn't have to be that way. With the right training, I can see ou being a good magic user. What do you say, uh?</q></p>
            <p><q class="protag">Marion,</q> you say.</p>

            <p>You tell Rhubarb the news, and she seems to light up. <q class="rubie">My best friend, a celebrity in the making!</q> But something seems...strange. You don't know why, but as you make the call to Mr. Paeonia, and as you sit down to discuss what will be expected with you at this apprenticeship, something feels wrong.</p>

            <p>You think about for a moment. You? Using <em>magic</em>? It was such an outlandish thought. Then again, you were in the most outlandish place in South Everywhere.</p>
            <p>But then you thought about your father. He would never approve of you practicing magic, especially after what happened to your mother. The thought of her made your heart swell as you thought back to those few years of your life that you were able to know her.</p>

            <p>In a few moments, Rhubarb runs to you and wraps you in a big hug. <q class="rubie">Guess who just scored an apprenticeship with <em>the</em> Madame Phantasm?!</q> She's so very happy, and you can't help but smile.</p>
            <p><q>How about I give you kids a ride home?</q> Madame Phantasm offers. <q>These woods can be dangerous, you know.</q></p>
            <p> And just like that, you all were off, flying above the unusual purple landscape. It's funny to think that this was a place that you thought was scary. Now, it feels almost like a second home. Well, okay, maybe not. But still, this place was familiar now. Something felt more at-ease about it. Or maybe that was just you.</p>
            <p>You looked pover at Rhubarb, who looked around giddily. She would make a great magic user. You could tell. And maybe one day, you would try magic, too. But that's a story for another day. But today is new and full of change. And sometimes, you just gotta take a risk, even for a little while.</p>

            <p>More Rhubarb designs. Ended up going with the one on the far right.</p>

            <p>A scrapped visual that I was going to use for Rhubarb's question scene. These were going to be their final designs, but we had to cut them for time.</p>

            <p>I had started to digitalize the scrapped drawing. Did I finish it? Nobody knowssssss.</p>
            <h4>Writing Stuff</h4>
            <p>Initial Gist: You are Marion, a young citizen of South Everywhere and one of the few people of the land who still do not use magic. One day, you’re walking to work, and your friend, Rhubarb, asks you to accompany her on an “expedition” through the Outta-Wack Woods, and from there, your journey begins. Good luck, adventurer.
</p>
            <p>Originally, the decision to go with Rhubarb or not was going to be on the same part of the page as the exposition, but this was changed for the sake of readibility and for the Map of South Everywhere. The way Rhubarb presents her question, however, was always going to be the way in turned out. <q>Rhubarb will approach the user and ask them to come along on her adventure into the Woods. You can either agree to go willingly or attempt to tell her no.</q></p>
            <p>A lot of stuff went according to the original plan. <q>If you automatically say yes, Rhubarb will be overjoyed, and you two will automatically end up in the forest. Telling Rhubarb no will result in her begging you to join her until you reluctantly agree. You will end up in the forest regardless.</q></p>
            <h4>Original Endings</h4>
            <p><strong>Worst Ending (From not choosing “Follow Rhubarb”)</strong>: You get lost in the woods, the earth reclaiming you as you begin to be buried beneath the dirt. (Slow death)</p>
            <p><strong>Bad Ending {SCRAPPED} (From choosing to follow the trail of fireflies)</strong>: You and Rhubarb are led to a strange cave. Rhubarb steps inside, so you join her once you think it’s safe, only for the “entrance” to slam shut. Suddenly, the cave starts to shift, and then you and Rhubarb are launched into the air. The Outta-Wack Woods have spit you both out, and you are flung away, your fate left unknown.
</p>
            <p><strong>Mediocre Ending (From deciding not to go inside the strange shop)</strong>: You and Rhubarb continue to walk through the woods until you reach a tree with a face. The tree tells you that life is about taking risks and stepping outside of your comfort zone, and if you continue to avoid every slightly new experience, you will never truly be able to live life. You tell the tree that its advice is stupid. You lead Rhubarb past the tree ony to wind up back outside the woods. Rhubarb tells you that the tree had a point, and then she leaves.</p>
            <p><strong>Unusual Ending (From eating a piece of the yellow-flavored candy)</strong>: You start to feel dizzy and pass out onto the floor. You “wake up” in a field of weird orange ferns, and a large figure ascends from the sky to tell you that she’s here to reach out to you about your car’s extended warranty. Then you wake up in a cold sweat, at home. 
</p>
            <p><strong>False Ending (From accepting Madame Phantasm’s apprenticeship offer)</strong>: Madame Phantasm is happy, and invites you inside her home for brunch, but you feel…strange.</p>
            <p><strong>True Ending (From declining Madame Phantasm’s apprenticeship offer)</strong>: You tell Madame Phantasm that you don’t really practice magic, and that you already have a pretty satisfactory job. Phantasm understands, and offers to fly you back to work. Rhubarb, though, accepts the apprenticeship. You point out to her that being an apprentice counts as a job and that she would be “succumbing to the evil that is capitalism” but Rhubarb just says “Sometimes you just gotta try something new. Life’s about taking risks and stepping out of your comfort zone, right?” </p>

            <h4>Other Fun Coding Notes</h4>
            <p>I had to remove a feature that acted as a reset button so you wouldn't have to reload the page everytime you hit a non-true ending, and it would've been on the true ending page and at the end of this page, but it didn't work out as planned. Couldn't get the original button on the exposition screen to come back.</p>
            <p>I hope you enjoyed this project I created. Have an excellant day, and stay magical. Or don't. </p>
